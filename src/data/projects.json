      "status": "completed",
      "description": "Interactive LED poi using persistence of vision effects to create stunning light displays. Features programmable patterns, motion sensors, and wireless synchronization for dynamic flow art performances.",
      "longDescription": "This project combines my passion for flow arts with advanced electronics programming. The poi create visual patterns through precisely timed LED sequences that appear to float in the air due to persistence of vision effects. Each poi contains 144 individually addressable LEDs, an IMU for motion detection, and wireless communication for synchronized performances.",
